        <p class="paragraph">
            As one of the Community Outreach Directors of the Women in Science and Engineering club, one of the responsibilities
            include organizing community events throughout the school year. The UofT Mathematics Department reached out to
            our team to organize workshops for girls in grades 6-8 for their "Girls in STEM" program.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            We had 50 girls in attendance total from local middle schools of the GTA, where they got to attend a two-part
            workshop organized by my co-director Talia and I. We led a water solubility, density, and polarity
            science/engineering workshop with water and oil led by Talia, and a coding efficiency workshop led by me.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            We were not only so excited to be able to give a glimpse of STEM to the younger generation, but also
            we were so inspired by their passions for their futures. We got a lot of aspiring engineers, teachers,
            lawyers, doctors, and more.
